<body><h1>Interstellar</h1><hr>
<p> Interstellar is important because it explores deep scientific concepts like black holes, time dilation, and relativity while delivering an emotionally powerful story about love, survival, and humanity's future. Its realistic depiction of space, backed by physicist Kip Thorneâ€™s research, makes it one of the most scientifically accurate and visually stunning sci-fi films ever made. ðŸš€ðŸ’«</p>
